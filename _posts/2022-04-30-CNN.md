## Structure
In deep learning, a CNN(convolutional neural network) is a class of artificial neural network, most commonly applied to analyze visual imagery.  
Fully connected neural networks (FCNNs) are a type of artificial neural network where the architecture is such that all the nodes, or neurons, 
in one layer are connected to the neurons in the next layer.


### CNN vs Fully Connected

### Limitation of Fully Conneted 
Fully connected neural network ignores the shape of data.  
When itput data is image data, we'd have to covnvert 3-dimensional data to 1-dimensional data.  
Image data is 3-dimensional data and the shape has important dimensional information such as the distance between pixels in the space and channels between 
RGB.  
However, CNN keeps the shape of data. 3-dimensional data can be used as input data. In CNN, input/output data is also called feature map.
