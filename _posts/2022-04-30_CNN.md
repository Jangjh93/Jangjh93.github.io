## Structure
In deep learning, a CNN(convolutional neural network) is a class of artificial neural network, most commonly applied to analyze visual imagery.  
Fully connected neural networks (FCNNs) are a type of artificial neural network where the architecture is such that all the nodes, or neurons, 
in one layer are connected to the neurons in the next layer.
