## Structure
In deep learning, a CNN(convolutional neural network) is a class of artificial neural network, most commonly applied to analyze visual imagery.  
Fully connected neural networks (FCNNs) are a type of artificial neural network where the architecture is such that all the nodes, or neurons, 
in one layer are connected to the neurons in the next layer.


### CNN vs Fully Connected

### Limitation of Fully Conneted 
Fully connected neural network ignores the shape of data.  
When itput data is image data, we'd have to covnvert 3-dimensional data to 1-dimensional data.  
Image data is 3-dimensional data and the shape has important dimensional information such as the distance between pixels in the space and channels between 
RGB.  
However, CNN keeps the shape of data. 3-dimensional data can be used as input data. In CNN, input/output data is also called feature map.
  
### Computation of CNN

### Padding
Before computing CNN, we often add layers of certain values('0') to the input data. This is for adjusting the size of output. For example, when (4,4) input data has (3,3) filter, the output will be (2,2). As computation goes on, the size output will be smaller and become 1 at a point.
