As we've learned in Chapter2, in theory, we can implement complicated logics with perceptron.
However, it still requires human to do the calculations to select proper values for weights.  
Neural Network can solve this problem.

## Perceptron to Neural Network
A neural network is a network or circuit of neurons, or in a modern sense, an artificial neural network, composed of artificial neurons or node.

Let's review perceptron first.  
y = 0(b+w1x1 + w2x2 <=0) where b is bias  
y = 1(b+w1x1 + w2x2 > 0) where b is bias   
  
Making the eqautions simpler,  
y = h(b + w1x1 + w2x2)  
h(x) = 0 (x <= 0)  
h(x) = 1 (x >  0)  
h(x) is called Activation Fucntion.
